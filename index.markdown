My name is Elias Frigård and I’m a saxophone player from Sweden living in Helsinki, Finland. I play mostly traditional and contemporary Nordic Folk Music with influences from Jazz and Improvisation, while appearing as sideman in many different projects. Here you can find music and information about my different bands, upcoming performances, my contact information and a bit of my life story.
