My name is Elias Frigård. I'm a 27 years old guy and from Gävle, Sweden who is living in Helsinki, Finland at the moment. I decided to move here in 2017 because I wanted to connect with my finnish background. On this webiste you can find some useful information about me, as well as some coding projects that I'm working on as part of my studies and maybe some own projects in the future.

I've spent 20 years of my life playing music and am just about to finish my masters degree at the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki, which is why I've also decided to share some of my music with you here on this page! My other big interest in life has always been technology and computers, which is why I decided to start my studies at UDM this fall. My dream is to sometime in the future be able to combine my two areas and make something useful with what I have from both sides.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or ideas about new projects or any that kind of stuff. Take care!
